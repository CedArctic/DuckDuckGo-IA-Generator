Ludwig Von Drake is a tool designed to automate the process of creating Cheat Sheet Instant Answers for the DuckDuckGo search engine. The code is easy to read and modify thanks to the documentation (in the form of comments). Feel free to check it out. To run the tool, just download the cpp file and compile it yourself or download one of the releases (coming soon).

# Updates:
16/9/2017 - DuckDuckGo has put DuckDuckHack into maintenance mode and thus shall not be accepting any new contributions for the time being. This tool will probably be updated when DuckDuckHack opens up again.
